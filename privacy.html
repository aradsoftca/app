      <li>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile
          applications (collectively referred to as “the Apps”). By installing or using any of our Apps, you agree to
          the terms described below.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our Apps are designed to respect your privacy. Depending on the specific features of each App, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

        <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          We <strong>do not require or collect personal information</strong> such as your name, email address, phone number,
          or physical address unless the App specifically asks for it (for example, if you contact us for support).
        </p>

        <h3>b. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect non-identifiable information automatically, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
          <li>App usage statistics (e.g., number of sessions, crash reports)</li>
          <li>Anonymous analytics to improve performance and user experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data <strong>cannot identify you personally</strong> and is used only in aggregated form.</p>

        <h3>c. Advertising and Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Some Apps may use trusted third-party tools (like Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics, or similar services) to display ads
          or analyze usage. These services may use cookies or anonymous identifiers to deliver relevant content and measure performance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the functionality and performance of our Apps</li>
          <li>Fix bugs and technical issues</li>
          <li>Understand usage trends and enhance user experience</li>
          <li>(If applicable) deliver ads and measure their effectiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>never sell, rent, or share your personal data</strong> with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our Apps are intended for general audiences. If an App is specifically designed for children, we comply with the
          <em>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</em> and do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under
          13 years of age. If you believe that your child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it immediately.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the data we collect. However, please understand that
          <strong>no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure</strong>, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request access to or deletion of your data</li>
          <li>Opt out of analytics or personalized advertising</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can usually manage these options from your device’s privacy settings or by contacting us directly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
