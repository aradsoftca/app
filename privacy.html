Privacy Policy

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile applications (collectively referred to as “the Apps”).
By installing or using any of our Apps, you agree to the terms described below.

2. Information We Collect

Our Apps are designed to respect your privacy.
Depending on the specific features of each App, we may collect the following types of information:

a. Personal Information

We do not require or collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address unless the App specifically asks for it (for example, if you contact us for support).

b. Non-Personal Information

We may collect non-identifiable information automatically, such as:

Device model and operating system version

App usage statistics (e.g., number of sessions, crash reports)

Anonymous analytics to improve performance and user experience

This data cannot identify you personally and is used only in aggregated form.

c. Advertising and Analytics

Some Apps may use trusted third-party tools (like Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics, or similar services) to display ads or analyze usage.
These services may use cookies or anonymous identifiers to deliver relevant content and measure performance.

3. How We Use Information

The information we collect is used to:

Improve the functionality and performance of our Apps

Fix bugs and technical issues

Understand usage trends and enhance user experience

(If applicable) deliver ads and measure their effectiveness

We never sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.

4. Children’s Privacy

Our Apps are intended for general audiences.
If an App is specifically designed for children, we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under 13 years of age.
If you believe that your child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it immediately.

5. Data Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the data we collect.
However, please understand that no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:

Request access to or deletion of your data

Opt out of analytics or personalized advertising

You can usually manage these options from your device’s privacy settings or by contacting us directly.

7. Third-Party Links

Some Apps may include links to third-party websites or content.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
Any changes will be posted with an updated “Last updated” date.
You are encouraged to review this Policy regularly.
